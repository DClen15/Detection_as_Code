# Detection_as_Code

This repository is a centralized home for all of my code-based detection experiments and projects. You'll find a variety of folders here, each containing different types of detections—ranging from simple proofs of concept to more complex, project-specific implementations.

Some detections may be more niche or tightly tied to specific research efforts. In those cases, I’ll usually publish a blog post to dive deeper into the technical details and context behind them.

Stay tuned for ongoing updates as I explore new detection engineering ideas and techniques.
